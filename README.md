# wapp-group-spammer
This is a Python script that spams one of your contacts with What's App group chats. 
It uses Selenium for creating an instance of What's App Web, and after that, it uses XPATH hooks to simulate user interactions.

# Usage
First things you need to do is to make sure you have all the Selenium drivers installed. After that, edit the script by changing the five constants:

`CONTACT_NAME` = the name of the contact you want to attack

`GROUP_NAME` = the name of the groups

`NUMBER_OF_GROUPS` = how many groups do you want to create

`DELAY` = the dealy <em>(in seconds)</em> between the actions done by the script

`DELAY_COEFICIENT` = the multiply coeficient of the delay for generating the group


After all of this steps, run the script from the console by typing 
`py groupbot.py`
A new window will appear, and after you scan the QR Code with the app on your phone, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to initiate the script.

#### ENJOY!
